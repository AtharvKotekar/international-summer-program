        <p>Step 1 : Review YYIS eligibility criteria.</p>
        <p>Step 2 : Review the application process.</p>
        <p>Step 3 : Review a PDF of a sample blank application, and start preparing to answer as many application questions as possible.</p>
        <p>Step 4 : You will need to submit contact information for a parent/guardian, teacher, and/or official at your school. Reach out to them as soon as possible to review the PDF of a sample blank application with you, and be sure to collect the information you need.</p>

        <h2>Complete the application </h2>
        <p>Step 5 : Click Apply Now to start your YYGS application. Be sure to write down your email and password to access the application at a later time.</p>
        <p>Step 6 : Check the “Review” page of the application to see if you are missing any required components, and re-visit any pages that require further information.</p>
        <p>Step 7 : Once your application is complete, click on the “Review” page. Next click on the “Submit Application” button at the bottom of the page. </p>
        <p>Step 8 : In your Applicant Status Portal, pay the $70 USD Early Action fee or $85 USD Regular Decision fee*.  All YYGS application fees are non-refundable.
          <br /><br />
          If you submitted a completed Fee Waiver request, then you can check your Applicant Status Portal to see when it is approved or denied. If your Fee Waiver Request is denied, then your application will not be reviewed until the YYGS application fee is paid.</p>
        <p>Step 9 : Check your inbox for a YYGS confirmation receipt that indicates the successful submission of your application. Confirmation emails usually arrive within 24-48 hours of submission, due to occasional delays payment processing.</p>
